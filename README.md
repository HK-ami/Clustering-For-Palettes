A clustering model (MiniBatchKMeans) was applied on the data separating them into 12 clusters, which provided a colors palette for the picture.

Applying the same model to the data of Sunflowers picture, but keeping the previous clusters, it was obtained a recolored version of Sunflowers with the Starry Night's color palette.
